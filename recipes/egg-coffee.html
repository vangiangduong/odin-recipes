   <p>
    To the average Westerner, the thought of a cup of coffee mixed with any bit of egg might sound odd, and possibly unpleasant. But coffee with eggs is not uncommon in other cultures, as adding them to coffee makes a rich and delicious beverage, ideal for a pick-me-up and a flavorful boost of energy. The Vietnamese take on this treat makes for a dessert coffee, a silky concoction comprised of a sweet eggy foam floating atop of a cup of dark brew. Imagine a tiramisu in beverage form and you will likely get pretty close to the vibe of a good egg coffee. Just a few minutes of work might make you a believer in egg coffee, as its delicious flavor and texture might make your morning coffee look in need of that oomph.

    Norwegians and the Swedish have their version, mixing the eggs and shells with the ground coffee and boiling it with water. For the Vietnamese version, "custard coffee‚Äù might be more accurate, as this thick, strong, and dark coffee is topped with a sweet, light, and airy foam of egg yolk and condensed milk. The opposing flavors and textures are what make the egg coffee a favorite, so using a strong brew is recommended, as is beating the yolks and condensed milk to an airy foam.

            <ul>
                <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>For the Coffee:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>60 grams French roast coffee, finely ground</li>
                <li>4 1/8 cups hot water</li>

                <li>Combine the egg yolk, condensed milk, and vanilla in the bowl of a standing mixer. Beat with the wire whisker on high for about 10 minutes. The appearance should be similar to a cake batter, not especially frothy.</li><br>
                <img src="../images/foam-02.webp"><br><br>
                <li>To test for the right consistency, spoon a small amount of the foam on top of a glass of water. If it floats it has the right consistency. If not, whip it for a few more minutes.</li><br>

                <li>Divide the remaining brewed coffee among four to six cups. If desired, set each cup in a small bowl of hot water to prolong the warmth of the coffee.</li><br>
                <img src="../images/coffee-02.webp"><br><br>
                <li>Gently spoon some of the whipped egg foam onto the top of each coffee, 1 to 2 tablespoons per cup.</li><br>
                <img src="../images/coffee-03.webp"><br><br>
                <li>Pour a bit of the reserved coffee through the foam in each cup. Dust with cocoa powder is desired. Serve immediately.</li><br>
