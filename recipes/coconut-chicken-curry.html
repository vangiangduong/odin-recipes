   <p>
    Vietnamese curries are not as well known as Indian or Thai curries, but they are just as flavorful and bold in flavor. More of a stew than the curries you might have tried, Vietnamese curries stand out from similar preparations in India or Thailand due to the pronounced coconut flavor and generous use of fish sauce, a common ingredient in many Vietnamese recipes. In our version for cà ri gà, or chicken curry, coconut milk gives the curry a mild sweetness and a luxurious creaminess. Chunks of Russet potatoes, sweet potatoes, and carrots add texture and bulk to make this curry filling and satisfying.

    In Vietnamese cuisine, careful design and balance of flavors and ingredients were already key before it was heavily influenced by the French presence in the country starting in the late 19th century when France took over Vietnam and Cambodia. The French heritage that was left behind after 1954 is clearly seen in today's Vietnam and its mixed culinary traditions. Potatoes, onions, coffee, varied pastries and desserts, broths, and stocks are only a small part of what the French left behind in local kitchens. That's why, when eating curry in Vietnam, the only possible side dish you can think of is a slice, or many, of Vietnamese baguette—instead of rice like in Thailand or flatbread like in India.
